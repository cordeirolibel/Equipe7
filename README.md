The project aims to predict child mortality risk based on factors related to the mother and gestation. Statistical techniques such as predictive modelling and machine learning were used, with a high success rate when compared to other consolidated techniques, to predict mortality of newborn children, basing its assumptions on a few selected parameters readily available on current government databases. Only historical data was used, focusing on predictive actions and serving as an extra metric to be used when assessing risk associated with  the moment of birth and subsequent year, empowering health professionals and government.
